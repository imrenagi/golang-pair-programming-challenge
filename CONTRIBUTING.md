## During Pairing

> Please be mindful that this challenge is not for taking who is the best at coding, but for showing the people how to work together as a team especially 
with TDD by thinking out loud. So dont you dare muting your microphone or not talking while coding. LOL. So no pressure and just enjoy the show :D

1. Introduce yourself. 
1. Sometime imre will ask you to explain somethinig. either it is the problem that we want to solve or definition of some terminologies. Get reaady! LOL
1. Swear words are allowed during the coding. Feel free. In the episode finale I will announce the episode whose the most swear words. LMAO
1. Since we are using TDD, we gonna write test and implementation by consecutively changing the role between driver and navigator. So If you are now writing the implementation, on the next requirement you will write the tess. 
Make sure to fail the test first before working on the implementation. If you see some chances to refactor, please do so after the implementation and re-run the test. Do this until all requirement is completed.

Don't get intimidated. Im no good at algorithm and data structure. That's why I invited you! LMAO
